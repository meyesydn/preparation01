After reading the Kohn article it led me to start thinking and reflecting on my college experience so far. 
Many times, throughout my education I have found myself thinking about if I am even smart enough to succeed in the Statistics field.
Which is a scary thought, because this is what I plan on doing for the rest of my life.
I think a big factor in this is grades. I have always been a strong A student having a gpa around a 3.75 my whole college career, 
so based off that gpa you could conclude that I do know somewhat what I am doing. So that is why it is sometimes scary I do not feel that way.
I believe all of this could be, because I am usually so focused on what grade I am going to get in a class, 
instead of what I am learning in a class. If I were not to be graded and my focus was more on content, I do believe this feeling 
I have would somewhat go away and I would be more confident in my abilities.

Further reflecting on my experience with grades, I have noticed in classes that grades were not the major focus, and the focus was more on 
learning, I have been more engaged through the class. A situation like this happened with my INT 100 class. This class is relatively easy and I 
knew that more than likely I would receive an A in this course. That led me into not really thinking about the grade aspect and I was fully engaged in 
every class period.  For that reason, I think that is why I got so much out of the course and is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at 
Grand Valley.

Overall, I wish that one day grades were not a factor in how we are evaluted as a student. I think a better system would
be participation and how frequently you participate.
Participating you have to be fully engaged in the converstation and talking with one another and that is where I think the most learning is done.
If students were graded on only participation, students would have no choice but to think deeply and try as hard as they can to learn a topic.
This would eliminate the problem of taking a short way out, because the short way out would leave them with a bad grade!
